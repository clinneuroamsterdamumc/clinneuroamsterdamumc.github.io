<h1>Data preprocessing</h1>
This page is dedicated to shared code for data preprocessing. Code is categorized by type of analysis. Please use the corresponding citations if you are using code from this page.

<h2> MS-preprocessing pipeline</h2>
This pipeline is designed for structural MRI preprocessing specifically for studies related to multiple sclerosis (MS) using T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images. It includes several preprocessing steps to automatically segment and fill MS lesions, as well as, to perform FreeSurfer preprocessing and quality check (QC) for each step.

<h2>Connectivity preprocessing pipeline</h2>
This code will perform anatomical, functional and diffusion preprocessing to facilitate resting-state functional connectivity and/or diffusion-based structural connectivity studies.
